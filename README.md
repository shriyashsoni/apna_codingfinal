## What We Need Help With

We are working on several key aspects of the platform, and we are inviting open-source contributors to help build and improve the following:

1. **Admin Portals**: We need a more intuitive, feature-rich admin portal to manage platform data and users effectively. Admins need to easily update hackathon details, internship listings, job opportunities, and more.

2. **APIs for Hackathon Updates**: Develop APIs that will allow us to update hackathon details seamlessly on our website in real-time.

3. **Job and Internship Updates**: Create APIs and back-end solutions to allow for continuous and automated updates of job and internship opportunities for our users.

4. **Course and LMS Updates**: Help us develop and manage the integration of **learning management systems (LMS)** to manage courses, exams, and student progress.

5. **Website Development**: Contribute to the ongoing development of the Apna Coding website, including front-end updates, design improvements, and functionality features.

We welcome contributions from anyone — whether you’re a developer, designer, or someone with ideas to share.
